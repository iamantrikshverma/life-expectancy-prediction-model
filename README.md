# Life Expectancy Prediction Model

##  Overview
This project analyzes global health and socio-economic indicators to understand and predict life expectancy using data analytics and regression modeling techniques.

The analysis follows a structured data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
